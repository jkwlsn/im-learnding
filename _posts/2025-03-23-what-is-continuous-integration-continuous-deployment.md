Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (or Delivery) (CD) are essential processes in modern software development, but what are they?

## Continuous Integration

Continouous integration is when developers merge with the main branch as often as possible. This is in contrast to other practices where changes are merged on Release Day. The idea is that small and frequent merges and tests mean there will be fewer conflicts, bugs, and failed tests at one point in time.

Testing is essential to Continuous Integration. Testing ensures that the application isn't broken when the changes are merged to main.

## Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery extends the principlel of Continous Integration. With Continuous Delivery, all passing merged changes are automatically deployed to a testing environment. This allows you to release new versions of the software whenever you feel like.

## Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment extends the principle of Continuous Delivery; all passing changes are automatically released to users. In this process, there is no release day, software is continuously updated. The idea is that any bugs can be caught by users.
